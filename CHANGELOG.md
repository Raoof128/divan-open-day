## 2026-07-12 — Repository baseline

**Raouf:**

- **Scope:** DIVAN release-1 implementation bootstrap.
- **Summary:** Created the protected greenfield repository baseline, recorded active engineering rules, excluded credentials and generated output, and documented the evidence-driven implementation sequence.
- **Files Changed:** `.gitignore`, `.dockerignore`, `AGENT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/implementation-plan.md`.
- **Verification:** The initial commit is created on `main` with `.env` excluded; feature work proceeds on `feat/divan-open-day-r1` and isolated writer branches.
- **Follow-ups:** Build and independently verify every local acceptance criterion while keeping unavailable production, rights, human-review, and physical-event gates closed.
